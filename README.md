# 🌤️ Weather App

A clean, responsive weather web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that displays real-time weather information for any location in the world. The app fetches live data using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and shows current temperature, weather condition, and wind speed, with custom visual styling and PNG icons.
